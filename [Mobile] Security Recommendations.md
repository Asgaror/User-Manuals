Here are some security recommendations to ensure maximum security for your coins:

**Keeping your Seed Safe**

**Creating a Strong PIN Code**


## Keeping your Seed Safe

A Seed is the most critical component of your Mobile Wallet, and it should be kept safe under all circumstances.  
It is important to note that, ***anyone who has access to your Seed can remotely access, withdraw or spend your coins***, hence ensuring the safety of your Seed from any unauthorized access should be your prime concern.

As long as the Seed of your Wallet is safe with you and is not lost or stolen, no matter what happens to your Wallet, your coins will be safe.

Hence it is always recommended to keep your Seed in a safe and secure place.

The Seed of your Mobile Wallet is generated internally during a Wallet creation. You can either choose for a 12 word long Seed or a 24 word long Seed.  
Hence, unlike a password, you don't need to worry about the strength of a Seed. Instead, you should be keen to store the generated Seed safely.

The safest place to store your Seed is offline, and it is recommended that you should never store your Seed digitally.  
This is applicable for all digital devices including but not limited to Computers, Laptops, Mobiles, etc..

The recommended way to store a Seed is to **write it down in a paper** and then store it in a secure place, which is at the same time easily accessible and not prone to unauthorized access.  
Moreover, a secure offline location would vary with each individual, and it is best to leave that choice to yourself.

However, here are few precautionary measures for the safe storage and retrieval of the Seed:

* Make sure you have multiple copies of your Seed, stored in different locations.

* It is wise to make sure the paper, in which you are writing down the Seed, is less vulnerable to environmental elements.

* It is ideal that you are the only person to know about the location of the Seed.  
However, to be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances, you may share the location of at least one of the copies of the Seed with a trusted family member or friend.

* Keep your Seed away from a potential Camera, this includes CCTV cameras, personal cameras, etc.. 

* Do not read the words of your Seed out loud, under any circumstances.

## Creating a Strong PIN Code

The creation of a four-digit PIN Code for your Mobile Wallet is a mandatory step and needs to be completed during the initialization process.

You cannot skip this step and you will need to enter the PIN each time you open your Wallet.  
These steps are made a mandate to ensure optimal security and secure your coins from unauthorized access.

### Importance of a Strong PIN Code

A strong PIN code is the one which is at the same time easy to remember as well as hard to guess.  
Hence it is wise to avoid the usage of birthdates, years or sequential and repeating numbers.

To safeguard your coins from a potential hacker there is an exponential increase of waiting time between each incorrect PIN code entry, which makes it highly unlikely for the person to hack into your Mobile Wallet by trying different numeric combinations.

However, a PIN code that is easy to guess nullifies this layer of security, effectively exposing your Wallet to potential attacks.
