## 1. Lost/Stolen Skywallet

If your Skywallet is lost or stolen, the recommended solution is to **get a new one** as soon as possible. 

Once you got the new Skywallet, then restore the Coins using the Seed of your old Skywallet.

Even though **not a recommended** method, as an emergency step, you can also create a new software Wallet using your Desktop Wallet to restore the lost Skywallet.

This method is unrecommended and should only be opted as a last resort, as entering the Seed of your Skywallet into any electronic device could potentially compromise the security of the Seed of your Skywallet and hence putting your Coins at risk.

**NOTE - If you are opting for this solution, note that this is a temporary solution, and it is always recommended that you transfer your Coins(not restore the backup of the old Skywallet) to the new Skywallet as soon as you obtain one.  
Also, it is vital that you configure your new Skywallet as a new one with a new Seed and not restore the backup of your old Skywallet, as the Seed is already entered into your computer.**

## 2. Lost the PIN code of Your Skywallet

If you have forgotten or lost the PIN code to your Skywallet **then the only way to retrieve your funds is using your Seed**.

You can use the Seed of your Skywallet to **Wipe the Device** and then restore the device using the same Seed.

The wiped device will not have a PIN code set, and it is recommended that you immediately set a PIN code that is easy to remember but at the same time not easy to guess.

You can visit the following chapter to know more about setting a PIN and the security recommendations for your Skywallet - **(Optimize account security)[https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/Optimize-account-security].**

## 3. Too Many Transactions Issue

The issue of "Too many Transactions" occurs when you try to do a send transaction.

When you try to send Coins to another Wallet and if the particular transaction is having too many inputs or too many outputs, then an error message will be displayed upon pressing the "Preview" button or the "Send" button.

To rectify this error, you can split up your transaction into multiple transactions and then send the Coins.
