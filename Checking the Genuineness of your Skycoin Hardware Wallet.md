# Checking the Genuineness of your SkyWallet

## Checking your Skywallet Shipment Package for Tampering

Once you receive the Skywallet shipment, please check for any physical tampering or damage of any sorts to the package.

Tampering or damage can be anything from a small tear on the package to a package that is torn open.

**Please do not accept a shipment which seems to be tampered in any such ways.**

### A Tampered Shipment:

<Optional picture of a tampered shipment which is not absolutely torn open but a small tear or hole so that the user will understand even such a small tamper can also spoil the device it can also be a general picture rather than a skywallet shipment>

Upon opening the package, please ensure that the holographic sticker with the Skycoin logo on the box is not broken.

## Checking the Firmware

Skywallet is built to provide maximum security to the user.

However, it is always important to check whether your Skywallet is not somehow compromised before adding your coins to the wallet.

## Step 1 - Connecting Your Skywallet

As the first step, you have to connect the device to your USB port.

## Step 2 - Checking the message on your Skywallet's Display

### Scenario 1

The display screen equipped on your Skywallet displays one of the following three messages when connected via USB port, marking the authenticity of your Skywallet.

If the Skywallet is genuine, then the screen will display the following message:

**NEED SEED!**

Along with the Skycoin Logo.

### Scenario 2:

A Previously used Skywallet will have a Seed set up beforehand.

Hence the message **Need Seed!** will not be displayed and this denotes that your Skywallet is unsafe to use as someone else can access your Skywallet using that previously set up Seed.

**Please note that if you do not get a Need Seed! message on your first use of the Skywallet then immediately disconnect the device and contact the Skycoin support at**

### Scenario 3:

The third and final message that might be displayed is a warning:

**Unofficial Firmware Detected**

denoting that the firmware is not approved by Skycoin. Do **not** use a Skywallet displaying that warning as the software version on your wallet might be corrupted and it is ***unsafe*** to use the Skywallet.

**Please note that if you get an Unofficial Firmware Detected message on your Skywallet then immediately disconnect the device and contact the Skycoin support at**
