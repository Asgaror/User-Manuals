## Checking for Software/Technical Issues

Skycoin Hardware Wallet provides maximum security to the user.

However, it is always important to check whether your Skycoin Hardware Wallet is not somehow compromised before adding your coins to the wallet.

## Step 1 - Connecting Your Skycoin Hardware Wallet

To check for the genuineness, first, you have to connect the device to your USB port.

## Step 2 - Checking the message on the Wallet's Display

### Scenario 1

The display screen equipped on your Skycoin Hardware Wallet displays one of the following three messages when connected via USB port, marking the authenticity of your Wallet.

If the Skycoin Hardware wallet is genuine, then the screen will display the following message:

**NEED SEED!**

Along with the Skycoin Logo.

### Scenario 2:

A Previously used Skycoin Hardware Wallet will have a Seed set up beforehand.

Hence the message **Need Seed!** will not be displayed and this denotes that your Skycoin Hardware Wallet is unsafe to use as someone else can access your wallet using that previously set up Seed.

### Scenario 3:

The third and final message that might be displayed is a warning:

**Unofficial Firmware Detected**

denoting that the firmware used by the Wallet is not an approved version of Skycoin Software, this is extremely dangerous as the software version on your Wallet might be corrupted and using the said wallet is ***unsafe***.
