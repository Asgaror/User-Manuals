# Initializing your Skywallet

On successfully ensuring the genuineness of your Skywallet, you can begin with the initialization of it.

## Step 1 :

The first step in initializing your Skywallet is to install the Skycoin Desktop Wallet.

The Skycoin Desktop Wallet is used for the interaction between the Skywallet and the User.

Please make sure to download the latest compatible version from the Skycoin [Downloads](https://www.skycoin.net/downloads/) Page.

<If you are a Linux user then please make sure to run this script>

If you already have the latest Desktop Wallet installed and configured, then you can skip this step.

## Step 2:

Connect your Skywallet to the USB port.

## Step 3:

Once you have connected the Skywallet to the USB port, open the Skycoin Desktop Wallet.

If it is the first time you are using your Skywallet, please make sure to go through the following section of the user manual,(Checking the Genuineness of your Skywallet)[https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/How-to-check-whether-device-is-genuine], to ensure that you are using a genuine Skywallet.

The instructions for a Desktop Wallet which is used for the first time and an already configured Desktop Wallet are different.

### Step 3.1: First Time Use of a Desktop Wallet

If you are using the Desktop Wallet for the first time, you will see the following screen :
