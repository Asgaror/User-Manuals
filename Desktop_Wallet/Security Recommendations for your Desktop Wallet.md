# Security Recommendations for your Desktop Wallet

Security of your coins is the prime motive of Skycoin Wallets. 

Here are some security recommendations to ensure maximum security for your coins:

**Keeping your Seed Safe**

**Encrypting your Wallet**


## Keeping your Seed Safe

A Seed is the critical component of your Desktop Wallet, and it should be kept safe under all circumstances.  
It is important to note that, ***anyone who has access to your Seed can remotely access, withdraw or spend your coins***, hence ensuring the safety of your Seed from any unauthorized access should be your prime concern.

As long as the Seed of your Wallet is safe with you and is not lost or stolen, no matter what happens to your Wallet, your coins will be safe.

Hence it is always recommended to keep your Seed in a safe and secure place.

The Seed of your Desktop Wallet is generated internally during the Wallet creation. You can either choose for a 12 word long Seed or a 24 word long Seed.  
Hence, unlike a password, you don't need to worry about the strength of a Seed. Instead, you should be keen to store the generated Seed safely.

The safest place to store your Seed is offline, and it is recommended that you should never store your Seed digitally.  
This is applicable for all digital devices including but not limited to Computers, Laptops, Mobiles, etc..

The recommended way to keep a Seed is to **write it down in a paper** and then store it in a secure place, which is at the same time easily accessible and not prone to unauthorized access.  
Moreover, a secure offline location would vary with each individual, and it is best to leave that choice to yourself.

However, here are few precautionary measures for the safe storage and retrieval of the Seed:

* Make sure you have multiple copies of your Seed, stored in different locations.

* It is wise to make sure the paper, in which you are writing down the Seed, is less vulnerable to environmental elements.

* It is ideal that you are the only person to know about the location of the Seed.  
However, to be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances, it is best that you share the location of at least one of the copies of the Seed with a trusted family member or friend.

* Keep your Seed away from a potential Camera, this includes CCTV cameras, personal cameras, etc.. 

* Do not read the words of your Seed out loud, under any circumstances.

## Encrypting your Wallet

It is recommended that the Desktop Wallet should be password protected to ensure there is no unauthorized access.

The encryption of your Wallet can be done during its creation itself, although an optional security measure, it is always recommended to protect your Wallet with a password.

If you have not encrypted your Wallet during the creation of it, you can always opt to encrypt it by clicking on the **Encrypt Wallet** button next to the name of your Wallet.

Although not recommended, you can decrypt the Wallet in the same way by clicking on the Wallet and typing in the password.

### Importance of a Secure Password

A secure password is the one which is the combination of alphabets, numerals, and symbols.

However, it should also be one that is easy to remember.

Encrypting your Desktop Wallet with a secure password is critical to protect the coins from potential hackers who can get access to your system.

Thus it is always vital to encrypt your Wallet with a secure password, even though it is an optional feature.

### Limitation of a Password

A secure password is always recommended for the safety of your coins.  
However, in such a situation where your Seed is lost or stolen, a password would not be enough to ensure the safety of your coins.

Any person who has access to your Seed can remotely access your coins by using their Wallet to restore your coins.

As the password of your Desktop Wallet is local to your Desktop, the encryption would not be a hindrance in such circumstances.
