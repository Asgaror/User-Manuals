# Personalizing your Skywallet

After completing the initialization of your Skywallet, you can start to personalize your Skywallet using the Desktop Wallet.

Upon configuring your Skywallet, it will be listed in the Wallet list. The list can be viewed when you open your Desktop Wallet.

To personalize your Skywallet, connect your Skywallet via USB to your computer and then open the Desktop Wallet.

Once the Desktop Wallet is opened, click on the **Skywallet** button in the Desktop Wallet window.

Once you click on the "Skywallet" button, the following window will appear:

When you use the Skywallet for the first time, you will find two warnings associated with **Creating a Backup** and **Setting a Pin**, displayed in the Desktop Wallet window.

Both of these warnings are to be dealt with seriously, or it may compromise the security of your Skywallet.

To complete these two tasks, you can use the options in the Skywallet window.

Following are the options available in this window:

**Create a backup**

**Create PIN code**

**Wipe the device**

## Create a backup

The Seed of your Skywallet is a key component. A Seed is the only way to access the coins stored in your Skywallet. 

Once the initialization is complete, it is essential to backup this Seed and store it in a secure location.

To backup the Seed of your Skywallet, click on the button **"Create a backup"**.

Once you click the "Create a backup" button, a warning message will be displayed.

After accepting this warning message, the Skywallet will start to display the words in your Seed one by one.

![Seed_2](https://github.com/sreekumar13/hardware-wallet-manual/blob/master/Skywallet%20Screen%20Mockup%20Edit_Skywallet%20Black_05-2.png)

**You need to note down each of these words and store it in a secure location.**

**You would have obtained a Seed card along with your Skywallet, we recommend you to use this Seed card to note down your Seed.** 

**Note - Make sure that it is retrievable because if anything happens to your device, it will be impossible to retrieve your coins without the Seed.**

After completing the display of the words in the Seed, the screen displays ***all the words in the Seed again***, so that you can verify your entries.

**Note - After completing the Backup process, you cannot repeat the same. Hence it is essential to note the Seed down during this process. Once you have completed the backup process, the "Create a backup" button will be replaced by "Confirm Seed" button.**

To set the PIN, you have to use both the matrix as well as the Desktop Wallet window.

**Each position of the number in the matrix corresponds to its position in the keypad shown by the Desktop Wallet window.**

Alternatively, you can utilize the number keypad on your computer for entering the PIN. 

However, if you are using the number pad then note that **the position of the number in the matrix is what decides which number you are entering.**

After setting up your PIN, you can manage the PIN by changing or deleting the same. 

**Changing the PIN code**

Once you have created a PIN code, you can make modifications to your PIN code using the Skywallet window.

You can use the **Change PIN Code** option to change your current PIN code to a new one.

Upon clicking the "Change PIN Code" button, the Skywallet window will show you a keypad similar to the one you used to create the PIN code.

To change the PIN code, you have to enter the current PIN code first and then the new PIN code twice. 

**Deleting the PIN code**

However, you can choose to delete the PIN code of your Skywallet using the Skywallet window.

To delete the PIN code of your Skywallet, you can click on the **Delete PIN Code** button.
