# Initializing your Skywallet

After successfully checking that your Skywallet is genuine, you can begin with the initialization of your Skywallet.

## Step 1:

The first step in initializing your Skywallet is to install the Skycoin Desktop Wallet.

Please make sure to download the latest compatible version from the Skycoin [Downloads](https://www.skycoin.com/downloads/) Page.

If you already have the latest Desktop Wallet installed and configured, then you can skip this step.

## Step 2:

The next step is to download and install the daemon.

Following are the steps to install the daemon in different operating systems:

### Windows

* Download the [32bit](https://downloads.skycoin.com/skywallet-daemon/skyhwd-1.0.0-win-x86.zip) or [64bit](https://downloads.skycoin.com/skywallet-daemon/skyhwd-1.0.0-win-x64.zip) daemon. 

* Extract the files, by double clicking. Then double click the executable. 

* You have to manually run the daemon every time you want to use the Skywallet.

### macOS

* Download the [MacOS](https://downloads.skycoin.com/skywallet-daemon/skyhwd-1.0.0-osx-darwin-x64.pkg) daemon installer. 

* Double Click on the downloaded file and follow the instructions in the installer.

* Once completed, the daemon runs in the background and does not need to be run manually before usage of a Skywallet.

### Linux

* Open terminal on your Linux machine.

* Execute the following command using the terminal:  
* ```wget -O /tmp/skyhwd.deb https://downloads.skycoin.com/skywallet-daemon/skyhwd_0.1.0_amd64.deb```

* After the process is complete execute the following command:  
* ```dpkg -i /tmp/skyhwd.deb```

* Once completed, the daemon runs in the background and does not need to be run manually before usage of a Skywallet.

## Step 3:

Connect your Skywallet to the USB port. If you are using Windows, run the daemon before you continue.

## Step 4:

Once you have connected the Skywallet to the USB port, open the Skycoin Desktop Wallet.

If it is the first time you are using your Skywallet, please make sure to go through the following section of the user manual,[Checking the Genuineness of your Skywallet](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/User-Manuals/blob/master/Skywallet/1.%20Checking%20the%20Genuineness%20of%20your%20Skywallet.md), to ensure that you are using a genuine Skywallet.

If you have not used the correct version of the Desktop Wallet before, it is possible that the Desktop Wallet needs to synchronize the blockchain and displays this message:

Wait for the synchronization to finish before you use the device. 

To configure your Skywallet, proceed to click on **“Skywallet”** button at the bottom pane of your Desktop Wallet window.

To configure your Skywallet for the first time, you have to install the firmware for the Skywallet.

## Step 5: Installing the Firmware

To indicate the beginning of the firmware installation, the Desktop Wallet will show the following window:

![Firmware_Installation](https://github.com/sreekumar13/hardware-wallet-manual/blob/master/Initialization_firmware_installation.png)

You can click on continue and follow the instructions to complete the firmware installation for your Skywallet.

The installation process will take a few seconds to complete.

After the firmware has been installed, unplug and reconnect the Skywallet. 

Once the installation is complete, you can proceed to configure the Skywallet.

**Note - If the installation process gets abruptly terminated for any reasons, you can disconnect the Skywallet, close the Desktop Wallet and then restart the whole process from the start.**

## Step 6: Skywallet Configuration

Once the firmware installation is complete, the “NEEDS SEED!” message is displayed by the Skywallet.

Simultaneously, the following window will be displayed by the Desktop Wallet.

In this window, you can select two options :

**“Configure automatically”**

### Step 6.1: Configure automatically

Once the configuration is complete, the following window will be displayed.

The restoration process is explained in detail in this section - [Restore Backup](https://github.com/SkycoinProject/User-Manuals/blob/master/Skywallet/6.%20Restoring%20Backup%20with%20an%20Existing%20Seed.md)
