# Checking the Genuineness of your Skywallet

## Checking your Skywallet Package for Tampering

Once you receive the Skywallet shipment, please check for any physical tampering or damage of any sorts to the package.

Tampering or damage can be anything from a small tear on the package to a package that is torn open.

**Do not accept a shipment which seems to be damaged in any such way.**

After opening the package, please ensure that the holographic sticker with the Skycoin logo on the Skywallet box is not broken.

## Checking the Firmware

The Skywallet is built to provide maximum security to the user.

However, it is important to check whether your Skywallet is not compromised before using it.

## Step 1 - Connecting Your Skywallet

As the first step, you have to connect the Skywallet to your USB port.


## Step 2 - Checking the message on your Skywallet's Display

The display screen equipped on your Skywallet displays one of the following three messages when connected via USB port, marking whether your Skywallet is authentic.

### Scenario 1

If the Skywallet is a genuine one and is being used for the first time, then the screen will display the following message:

**Welcome!**

**Please visit skycoin.net** 

Along with the Skycoin Logo.

A Skywallet that is being used for the first time will not have a firmware(the software interface) installed. 

Hence any message apart from this welcome message implies that your Skywallet has been tampered by a third party.

### Scenario 2:

A Previously used Skywallet will have a firmware initialized hence such a Skywallet will display the following message on its display screen:

**Need Seed!**

Along with the Skycoin Logo.

<A picture of the Hardware wallet which displays the message NEED SEED>

Getting a Need Seed! message on your first use means that your Skywallet is not a new one and has a firmware already initialized.

**Note - If you do get a Need Seed! message on your first use of the Skywallet then please refrain from using the device any further.**

Also for further assistance, **Please contact the support team immediately.**

Alternatively, you can detail your concerns and send an email to **support@skycoin.zendesk.com**

### Scenario 3:

The third and final message that might be displayed is a warning:

**Unofficial Firmware Detected**

denoting that the Skywallet is running on a firmware that is not approved by Skycoin. 

Do **not** use a Skywallet displaying that warning as the software version on your wallet might be corrupted and it is ***unsafe*** to use the Skywallet, as using the said wallet could potentially make you lose your coins.
