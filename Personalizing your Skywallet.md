# Personalizing your Skywallet

After completing the initialization of your Skywallet, you can start to personalize your Skywallet using the Hardware Wallet window in the Desktop Wallet.

Upon configuring your Skywallet using your Desktop Wallet, the Skywallet will be listed in the Wallet list.

The list can be viewed when you open your Desktop Wallet.

To personalize your Skywallet, you have to click on the **Hardware Wallet** button.

Once you click on the "Hardware Wallet" button, the following window will appear:

When you use the Skywallet for the first time, you will find these two warnings associated with **Creating a Backup** and **Setting a Pin** being displayed in the Desktop Wallet window.

Both of these warnings are to be dealt with seriously or it may compromise the security of your Skywallet.

In order to complete these two tasks, you can use the options in the Hardware Wallet window.

Following are the options available in this window:

**Create a backup**

**Create PIN code**

**Wipe the device**

## Create a backup

The Seed of your Skywallet is a key component. A Seed is the only way to access the coins stored in your Skywallet. 

Once the initialization is complete it is important to backup this Seed and store it in a secure location.

To backup the Seed of your skywallet, click on the button **"Create a backup"**.

Once you click the button, a warning message(?) will be displayed.

After accepting this warning message, the Skywallet will start to display the words in your Seed one by one.

<The warning message needs to be more clearly mentioned and possibly with the screenshot of the warning message>

**You need to note down each of these words and store it in a secure location.**

**You would have obtained a Seed card along with your Skywallet, we recommend you to use this Seed card to note down your Seed.** 

**Note - Make sure that it is retrievable because if anything happens to your device, it will be impossible to retrieve your coins without the Seed.**

After completing the display of the words in the Seed, the screen displays ***all the words in the Seed again***, so that you can verify your entries.

**Note - After completing the Backup process, you cannot repeat the same. Hence it is important to note the Seed down during this process. Once you have completed the backup process, the "Create a backup" button will be replaced by "Confirm Seed" button.**

## Create  PIN code

Creating a PIN code for your Skywallet enhances its security, as only a person with the PIN can access the device. 

To create a PIN for your Skywallet for the first time, click on the button - **Create PIN code**

Once you click on the button the following window will appear on the Desktop Wallet:

<Screenshot showing the window to create a PIN> 
<it is mentioned in the wiki page that the hash symbol which is currently used to mask the numbers in the keypad will be changed to dot, if so then the latest version screenshot will be needed>

Simultaneously a number Matrix will be displayed on your Skywallet display screen.

In order to set the PIN, you have to use both the matrix as well as the Desktop Wallet window.

**Each position of the number in the matrix corresponds to its position in the window shown by the Desktop Wallet.**

<The explanation can also be an edited image showing the correct position of the numbers in the masked keypad of the Desktop Wallet window>

Alternatively, you can utilize the number keypad on your computer for entering the PIN. 

However, if you are using the number pad then note that **the position of the number in the Matrix is what decides which number you are entering.**

***Note - While setting up your PIN you have to enter it twice.***

After setting up your PIN you can manage the PIN by changing or deleting the same. You can read more about it in this section (Managing your PIN)[https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/Manage-the-PIN-code]

## Wipe the device

**Wipe the device** button helps you to delete the data on your Skywallet.

Once you click on the "Wipe the device" button you will be asked for a confirmation message on both the Skywallet as well as Desktop Wallet.

While confirming, note that there is an option to remove the Skywallet from your Wallet list in the Desktop Wallet. By default, this option will be checked and if not unchecked your Skywallet will be removed from the Wallet list.

After confirming the warning message to wipe the device, **all the data in your Skywallet will be erased except for the firmware updates.** The firmware updates of your Skywallet cannot be erased and will remain the same as before even after the deletion process.

You can also restore all your coins by using the Seed of a previously configured Skywallet, details on how to restore your Wallet are available on this section (Restore Backup)[https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/Restore-configuration].
