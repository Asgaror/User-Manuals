# Optimizing the Security of your Skywallet

Even though the Skywallet provides greater security when compared to a Desktop Wallet, it is essential to follow these security optimizations to get maximum security benefit from your Skywallet.

Two things are necessary for a third party to access your funds in Skywallet, which is either the PIN code of the Skywallet or the Seed of the Skywallet.

You are recommended to create a secure PIN code, although, unless your Skywallet is lost or got stolen, no one can access it using the PIN code.

However, this is not the case for a Seed, and any hacker/malware which gets access to your Seed of the Skywallet can remotely access or steal your funds.

So when it comes to security optimizations, these are the two vital components to be considered.

## PIN Code

Your PIN code is a four-digit combination, and a brand new Skywallet which you receive via shipment does not have a PIN code.

Hence, it is essential first to set a PIN code right after you receive your Skywallet. If you want to know more about how to set the PIN code and personalize your Skywallet, please visit the user manual [Personalization of your Skywallet](https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/Getting-to-know-the-wallet).

Though the PIN code is a four-digit combination, it would not be easy for an attacker/hacker to try the different combinations and work it out. 

Because after each failed attempt, one has to wait for a specific time before attempting the next combination and with each failed attempt the waiting time increases exponentially, making it impossible for an attacker/hacker to obtain the PIN code that way.

However, such a security precaution is ineffective if you create the pin as an easy to guess one. 

Examples include but not limited to, important dates, or sequences (like 1234) or repeating digits(1111).

Hence a secure PIN code is something easy to remember and at the same time not easy to guess for a third party.

## Seed

A Seed of the Skywallet is even more critical than a PIN code, as a hacker/malware without access to your Skywallet physically, can remotely access or steal your fund just using the Seed.

As the Seed is not created by you and is a generated one by the device, you need not worry about the strength of the Seed as such.

**However, it is imperative to keep the backup of the Seed in a safe and accessible place, as it is the only way to access your funds if anything happens to your Skywallet.**

Following are some recommendations to backup and store your Seed safely:

* **Do not Store the Seed in an electronic device. Because storing a Seed in an electronic device effectively nullifies the security it ensures, as the electronic device is hackable by a potential hacker and can get access to your Seed.**
Hence it is recommended to store the Seed in a paper or a notebook which can then be stored in a safe place that is inaccessible to any unauthorized person at the same time not prone to any accidents.<br />
**The only instance when the Seed is entered into a computer is when you are restoring the backup of your Wallet**, in that case, the Skywallet and Desktop Wallet process the Seed in a secure way which ensures that a third party will not gain access to your Seed.<br />
The process is explained in detail in the section (Restore Backup)[https://github.com/skycoin/hardware-wallet/wiki/Restore-configuration].

* Create multiple copies of the Seed and store it in separate locations.

* Make sure to inform of at least one location of the Seed to your immediate family member(s) as a precaution in case of an emergency.

* You can also go for splitting up the Seed in parts to store it in different locations or to have a cipher code for the words in the Seed.<br /> However, both these methods have a risk factor and are not recommended approaches, unless you are ready to take the risk.
